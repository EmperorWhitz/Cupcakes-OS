# Cupcakes OS Hardware Testing

Use this when moving from VM testing to real machines.

## Before You Start

- rebuild the ISO locally with `make iso`
- verify the current checksum
- write the ISO to known-good USB media
- keep a second machine or phone nearby for notes, GitHub login, and recovery searches
- run `./scripts/check-scripts.sh`
- run `./scripts/check-desktops.sh`
- run `cupcakes-os-hardware-test --with-report` on the machine first when possible

## Quick Preflight

Before you spend time writing a USB, run:

```sh
cupcakes-os-hardware-test --with-report
```

or from the repo:

```sh
./scripts/cupcakes-os-hardware-test.sh --with-report
```

This does not replace a real Cupcakes OS boot, but it catches obvious problems:

- whether the machine is real hardware or still a VM
- whether UEFI is available
- whether internal install disks are visible
- whether graphics, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and audio hardware show up
- whether Cupcakes OS's support-report tooling works on that machine

## Machines To Cover

- UEFI desktop
- UEFI laptop
- older BIOS system if available
- NVMe storage
- SATA SSD or HDD
- Intel graphics
- AMD graphics
- NVIDIA graphics if available
- Wi-Fi laptop
- Bluetooth laptop

## Live Boot Checks

- system boots from USB without manual kernel edits
- live boot flow takes over `tty1`
- NetworkManager starts in stage one
- `nmtui` and `nmcli` can be used for Wi-Fi setup
- installer opens correctly
- internal disks are detected correctly
- USB install media is not confused with the target disk
- Ethernet works if connected
- Wi-Fi hardware appears in `ip -br link` or `iw dev`
- keyboard and touchpad work
- display brightness works on laptops
- audio devices appear
- `cupcakes-os-hardware-test --with-report` completes from the live session
- `cupcakes-os-support-report` includes hardware, boot, network, and Cupcakes OS version details

## Installer Checks

- Omarchy-inspired welcome screen renders correctly
- identity step works
- password confirmation and password reset path work
- desktop selection includes the expected supported profiles
- Openbox evaluates and can be selected
- optional GitHub login can be skipped cleanly
- disk selection shows the intended internal target disk
- generated config validation runs before `nixos-install`
- install completes without fatal errors
- bootloader validation runs before the installer reports success
- failure screen shows recent logs if something breaks
- generated `/mnt/etc/nixos/cupcakes-os-local.nix` does not duplicate `environment.systemPackages`
- generated `/mnt/etc/nixos/cupcakes-os/` contains `setup.desktop` and `setup-launcher.sh`

## First Boot Checks

- installed system boots without the USB attached
- Limine boots cleanly
- login works
- networking works
- Flathub is configured after first boot
- `cupcakes-os welcome` opens first-step quick actions
- `cupcakes-os doctor` reports Cupcakes OS health
- `cupcakes-os recovery` opens rollback, rebuild, repair, and report actions
- `cupcakes-os setup` opens the installed reconfiguration launcher
- `cupcakes-os desktop list` shows supported desktop profiles
- `cupcakes-os config` shows hostname, timezone, keyboard, desktop, wallpaper, user, disk, and state version
- `grab`, `search`, `term`, `start`, and `supdate` are available
- `sudo nixos update` works
- rollback works if an update is tested
- default wallpaper is applied
- dark mode defaults are applied for the chosen desktop
- GNOME wallpaper switching still updates accent/style on Cupcakes OS wallpapers

## ANIX Checks

- `anix show` handles a missing config with a clear `anix init` prompt
- `anix init` creates `/etc/nixos/anix.nix` seeded from the installed Cupcakes OS config
- `anix switch nix <profile>` dry-builds a named flake config before switching
- `anix switch nix stable`, `minimal`, `gaming`, `creator`, and `developer` resolve to flake outputs
- `anix rollback nix` uses the previous NixOS generation
- `anix save` creates a local Git snapshot of `/etc/nixos`
- `anix save` warns when possible secrets are present in config files
- `anix config set snapshots.push true` is opt-in and does not push by default
- `anix doctor` reports flake, Git, generation, and ANIX config health

## Laptop Checks

- suspend and resume
- lid close/open behavior
- battery reporting
- brightness keys
- audio output and microphone
- Wi-Fi reconnect after resume
- Bluetooth pairing

## Bug Report

If something goes wrong, collect:

```sh
cupcakes-os-support-report
journalctl -b --no-pager
```

If the installer failed, also keep:

- `/tmp/cupcakes-os-config.log`
- `/tmp/cupcakes-os-install.log`

Attach the generated `cupcakes-os-support-*.tar.gz` archive to your report when possible.
