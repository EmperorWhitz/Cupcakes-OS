Welcome to the Cupcakes OS wiki.

Cupcakes OS is a distro project built on top of NixOS with one main goal: make NixOS easier to approach without hiding the power underneath.

## Current Version

**DENALI 3.14** is the current stable release.

- DENALI 3.14 shipped the Omarchy-inspired TUI installer, stronger install validation, Cupcakes OS branding across boot and desktop, ANIX v1, and TinyPM v4.
- v2.5 delivered the installer reliability, NetworkManager, desktop matrix, QEMU helpers, and release-command cleanup work that v3 built on.

## What Cupcakes OS Adds To NixOS

- a focused live boot flow
- a guided installer with network setup and desktop selection
- branded bootloader, Plymouth, wallpaper, and Fastfetch defaults
- installed commands for welcome, doctor, recovery, config, desktop selection, setup, and updates
- TinyPM-flavored app commands: `grab`, `search`, `term`, `start`, `supdate`, and Cupcakes OS/ANIX system bridges
- ANIX helper workflows for snapshots, rollback, and profile switching

## Tool Split

- Cupcakes OS commands handle distro setup, recovery, health checks, and installed-system configuration.
- ANIX handles NixOS profiles, snapshots, rebuild previews, rollback, and friendly system settings.
- TinyPM handles apps, package sources, and bridges into Cupcakes OS/ANIX when useful.
