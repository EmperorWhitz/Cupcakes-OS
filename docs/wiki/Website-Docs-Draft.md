# Cupcakes OS DENALI 3.14 — Overview

This file is an overview of the Cupcakes OS project covering what each release delivered and where the project stands now.

## Current Version

**DENALI 3.14** — the current stable release.

Cupcakes OS is built on top of NixOS. The goal is not to hide NixOS; the goal is to make NixOS feel approachable from the first boot onward.

## What v2 Added

The v2 era moved Cupcakes OS from a branded NixOS build into something closer to a complete operating-system experience.

### Guided Install Path

The live image focuses on a guided installer instead of dropping users into raw setup work.

The installer owns:

- network setup
- identity and password setup
- desktop choice
- starter app bundle choice
- optional GitHub setup
- disk selection
- final review
- generated config validation
- install progress and logs

### Desktop Coverage

Cupcakes OS v2 expanded beyond a single desktop target.

The desktop matrix includes GNOME, Plasma, Hyprland, Sway, XFCE, Cinnamon, MATE, Budgie, LXQt, Pantheon, i3, AwesomeWM, Openbox, Niri, River, Qtile, BSPWM, Fluxbox, IceWM, Herbstluftwm, COSMIC, and MangoWM.

`scripts/check-desktops.sh` evaluates these profiles before release so broken profile options are caught early.

### Branding and First Login

Cupcakes OS v2 brought together:

- bootloader assets
- Plymouth theme
- wallpaper collection
- Fastfetch identity
- dark-first desktop defaults
- GNOME wallpaper/accent sync

### Management Tools

Installed systems include:

- `cupcakes-os welcome`
- `cupcakes-os doctor`
- `cupcakes-os recovery`
- `cupcakes-os config`
- `cupcakes-os desktop`
- `cupcakes-os setup`
- `sudo nixos update`
- ANIX helper commands
- TinyPM-flavored app commands

### Support and Testing

Cupcakes OS v2 added support-report and hardware-readiness tooling, plus release docs for VM and hardware testing.

## What v2.5 Delivered

v2.5 focused on making installs reliable.

- NetworkManager is forced on in the live installer
- Wi-Fi setup works through `nmtui` and `nmcli`
- installer failures show useful logs
- generated config is validated before `nixos-install`
- bootloader files are checked before claiming success
- wallpaper packaging no longer breaks on changed directories
- GNOME package/config duplication was fixed
- current nixpkgs LightDM and GNOME option paths were fixed
- all desktop profiles evaluate, including Openbox
- `make iso` only builds the ISO
- `make release` builds ISO, TinyPM package, and metadata
- QEMU helpers support fresh install disks, disk-only boot, and serial mode
- setup launcher assets are copied into both the live ISO and installed config tree

## What DENALI 3.14 Delivered

DENALI 3.14 is the identity, installer, and tooling release.

- Omarchy-inspired TUI installer with compact boxed fields and live install progress
- large Cupcakes OS wordmark in the installer header
- install validation before long builds
- post-install `cupcakes-os setup` reconfiguration
- ANIX v1 profile manager shipped: snapshots, diff/test/boot/switch/rollback workflows, doctor repair, NixOS module options
- TinyPM v4 shipped: first-class Cupcakes OS/ANIX/NixOS awareness, source reporting, repair shortcuts
- COSMIC desktop added to the supported matrix
- Cupcakes OS branding across boot, desktop, and fastfetch
- Limine as the installed-system bootloader with Cupcakes OS branding
- Modularity game engine added to the Developer app bundle (`grab modularity`)

## Build and Release Commands

```sh
make iso
make qemu-fresh
make qemu-disk
make release
make metadata
make tinypm-package
```

`make iso` is for fast ISO iteration. `make release` is for the full release bundle.

## Testing State

In good shape:

- ISO build
- script checks (`make check`)
- desktop profile evaluation (`make check-desktops`)
- QEMU fresh/disk boot helpers
- installer config validation
- support report tooling
- hardware-readiness preflight testing

Still needs wider coverage:

- more bare-metal Wi-Fi laptops
- more BIOS systems
- more NVIDIA systems
- more Windows-host VM checks
- longer post-install update and rollback testing
